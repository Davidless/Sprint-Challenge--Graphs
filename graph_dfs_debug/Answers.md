## The only changes I made to the debug portion of the Sprint involved the button. `this.Button` was misspelled and therefore didn't work.

## Changed some of the sizing for the graph display to make it all fit and not go outside the border of the box.

## Changed the color value on the ctx.fill so that it would represent more of the colors implemented throughout the code.

## Corrected a height to width error in the Render section.
